The ovulation period is in the middle of the two menstrual periods, that is, about the 14th day after menstruation. Some women will have a small amount of bleeding at this time, which is the phenomenon of ovulation bleeding. 1 to 2 days after ovulation, under the synergistic effect of estrogen and progesterone, the bleeding will stop automatically.

Because the amount of bleeding is small, the bleeding time is short, and bleeding does not occur in every menstrual cycle, it has no effect on health and fertility, so generally no treatment is required. It should be noted that if the bleeding during ovulation exceeds the normal menstrual flow or lasts for more than 5 days, you should go to the hospital for examination to rule out the lesions of the vagina, cervix, endometrium and ovary, and take oral contraceptives or place an intrauterine device for contraception For women, irregular uterine bleeding caused by inappropriate oral contraceptives or placement of intrauterine devices should also be ruled out.\nPatients says I want to ask, is there a chance of getting pregnant through external ejaculation?\nDoctor says There is little chance of pregnancy.\nPatients says Oh oh, will there be any leaks?\nPatients says If I ejaculate outside the body and go to urinate afterwards, will I not be pregnant?\nDoctor says The chances of getting pregnant are slim.\n"

Do you want some medicine?\nDoctor says Hello, combined with your symptoms, functional gastrointestinal disease (also called gastrointestinal dysfunction) is currently considered. There are many nerve endings and endocrine cells in the gastrointestinal tract. If your nerves and endocrine are sensitive, you will respond to slight stimuli in the environment, causing gastrointestinal dysfunction. Therefore, gastrointestinal dysfunction is closely related to mental state, psychological state, eating habits and sleep. Suggestion: You can take Bifeikang Capsules orally to regulate intestinal flora (antibiotics should not be taken during the period of taking drugs to regulate intestinal flora), and trimebutine maleate tablets can regulate gastrointestinal motility and other symptomatic treatments. It is recommended that you mainly adjust your diet and lifestyle to improve this disease: 1. Regular and moderate diet, regular and quantitative, and chewing slowly is conducive to intestinal digestion and absorption, and avoid overeating; 2. Avoid stimulating diets for suspicious diseases Tolerance or allergic food, such as shrimp, crab, etc. should be avoided as much as possible. Spicy, frozen, raw and cold food, late-night snacks, tobacco, alcohol, and coffee should be taboo; 3. Avoid high-fat diet. Diet should be light, easy to digest, and less greasy. A high-fat diet can cause abnormal digestive function. Therefore, it is necessary to limit the intake of fat, especially animal fat; try not to eat fried food, chocolate, ice cream, butter, etc. Take it for 2 weeks to see the effect, if it is effective, take it for another 2-4 weeks, and stop the drug after the symptoms are basically improved; if the effect is not good, please perform gastrointestinal endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound in time for a clear diagnosis and then targeted treatment. The specific medications are: 1. Bifco Capsules, 2 capsules at a time, 3 times a day; 2. Trimebutine Maleate Tablets, 1 tablet at a time, 3 times a day, taken with meals. Hopefully my answer is helpful to you! \u3297\ufe0f Healthy and happy!\nPatients says OK.\n"

Today is January 13. I would like to ask, can the patient drink a small amount of water and eat now? Thank you (male, 67 years old)\nDoctor says Hello! A 69-year-old man with a history of appendectomy and gastrectomy suffered from sudden abdominal pain and no spontaneous defecation. Diagnosis of intestinal obstruction, after targeted treatment, spontaneous exhaust and defecation, pain and flatulence disappear, indicating that intestinal obstruction is relieved, as long as the obstruction is relieved, the digestive tract can be unobstructed, and you can eat, but you must follow the steps and closely observe the abdominal situation after eating. Water, or rice soup, or enteral nutrition solution, if there is no discomfort, increase the amount and improve the quality, from full liquid food to semi liquid food! As long as there is exhaust and defecation, you can eat gradually, but pay attention to closely observe the reaction after eating! At the same time, it is necessary to pay attention to the following questions: Where is the intestinal obstruction blocked? What is the cause of the obstruction caused by what disease? Is it mechanical obstruction or dynamic obstruction? These issues need to be checked and judged accordingly to be clear!\nDoctor says Gastrectomy What disease is gastrectomy done? Adhesive obstruction and whether gastroscopy and colonoscopy are needed, all need to be discussed with the doctor to decide!\nPatients says Gastrectomy was performed more than ten years ago due to gastric ulcer bleeding.\nPatients says Now the location of intestinal obstruction pain is the lower right abdomen.\nPatients says There is no pain in other places.\nDoctor says Adhesive obstruction may exist, but tumor obstruction, fecal stone obstruction, and ischemic obstruction need to be checked.\nPatients says According to CT, the possibility of tumor was ruled out.\nDoctor says Gastrointestinal tumors sometimes cannot be ruled out by CT, and gastroscopy and colonoscopy are more reliable.\nDoctor says Unless the remnant stomach and colon tumor grows very large, it can only be seen on CT.\nPatients says Yes, the current situation is like this. The patient is relatively thin and has not eaten for a few days. He wants to eat first and gradually recover his body before doing colonoscopy. But the doctor said that the infusion should be continued until next Thursday or Friday, and the colonoscopy can only be done after the stool is exhausted.\nPatients says We are worried about whether the patient's body can bear it without food and infusion for five or six days.\nDoctor says You can try to eat and observe first, and then see if you can have a gastroscope and colonoscopy when the conditions are better, or you can arrange it after the Spring Festival.\nPatients says Can I eat and recover slowly before doing a colonoscopy?\nPatients says Gastroscopy is going to be done tomorrow.\nDoctor says Can! Do what you can!\nPatients says Now the main reason is that we ask to take a colonoscopy after discharge from the hospital, and eat slowly to adjust the body. Now the attending doctor says that even if you have a colonoscopy after discharge from the hospital, you have to wait until next Thursday or Friday to eat. , The flatulence pain has also disappeared, why can't I eat? So I came to ask the teacher.\nPatients says Thanks, I understand now.\nDoctor says OK! Clinically, it doesn\u2019t matter if you eat two days late in this situation. Although you can eat after you pass, you should eat under close observation. Once you feel unwell, stop eating!

"input": "Patients says Hello doctor, this is my problem: left abdominal pain for more than ten years (female, 40 years old)\nDoctor says Hello, may I ask what inspections you have done for so long?\nPatients says I had a colonoscopy four years ago with no problems.\nPatients says Recently checked the department of gynecology, liver, and stool tests are all fine.\nDoctor says Is the stool normal?\nPatients says Sometimes I can't get out when I want to pull. Sometimes it takes several times a day, and sometimes it takes a few days, and it is not clean and there is no blood in the stool.\nDoctor says Oh, if you think about it like this, it is likely to be a functional gastrointestinal disease!\nPatients says The stool is not very formed, not very runny,\nPatients says Do I need another colonoscopy?\nPatients says Now it hurts every day, not very painful, and I just can't pull it out when I want to defecate.\nDoctor says Hello, combined with your symptoms, functional gastrointestinal disease (also called gastrointestinal dysfunction) is currently considered. There are many nerve endings and endocrine cells in the gastrointestinal tract. If your nerves and endocrine are sensitive, you will respond to slight stimuli in the environment, causing gastrointestinal dysfunction. Therefore, gastrointestinal dysfunction is closely related to mental state, psychological state, eating habits and sleep. Suggestion: You can take Bifikang Capsules orally to regulate intestinal flora (antibiotics should not be taken while taking drugs to regulate intestinal flora), pinaverium bromide tablets (Deshute) to relieve intestinal spasm and other symptomatic treatments. It is recommended that you mainly adjust your diet and lifestyle to improve this disease: 1. Regular and moderate diet, regular and quantitative, and chewing slowly is conducive to intestinal digestion and absorption, and avoid overeating; 2. Avoid stimulating diets for suspicious diseases Tolerance or allergic food, such as shrimp, crab, etc. should be avoided as much as possible. Spicy, frozen, raw and cold food, late-night snacks, tobacco, alcohol, and coffee should be taboo; 3. Avoid high-fat diet. Diet should be light, easy to digest, and less greasy. A high-fat diet can cause abnormal digestive function. Therefore, it is necessary to limit the intake of fat, especially animal fat; try not to eat fried food, chocolate, ice cream, butter, etc. Take it for 2 weeks to see the effect, if it is effective, take it for another 2-4 weeks, and stop the drug after the symptoms are basically improved; if the effect is not good, please perform gastrointestinal endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound in time for a clear diagnosis and then targeted treatment. The specific medications are: 1. Bifco Capsules, 2 capsules at a time, 3 times a day; 2. Dexote (Pinaverium Bromide) Tablets, 1 tablet at a time, 3 times a day, taken with meals. Hopefully my answer is helpful to you! \u3297\ufe0f Healthy and happy! No colonoscopy for now!\nPatients says This has been the case for ten years.
