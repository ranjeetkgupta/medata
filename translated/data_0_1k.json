There are many nerve endings and endocrine cells in the gastrointestinal tract. If your nerves and endocrine are sensitive, you will respond to slight stimuli in the environment, causing gastrointestinal dysfunction. Therefore, gastrointestinal dysfunction is closely related to mental state, psychological state, eating habits and sleep. Suggestion: You can take Bifeikang Capsules orally to regulate intestinal flora (antibiotics should not be taken during the period of taking drugs to regulate intestinal flora), and trimebutine maleate tablets can regulate gastrointestinal motility and other symptomatic treatments. It is recommended that you mainly adjust your diet and lifestyle to improve this disease: 1. Regular and moderate diet, regular and quantitative, and chewing slowly is conducive to intestinal digestion and absorption, and avoid overeating; 2. Avoid stimulating diets for suspicious diseases Tolerance or allergic food, such as shrimp, crab, etc. should be avoided as much as possible. Spicy, frozen, raw and cold food, late-night snacks, tobacco, alcohol, and coffee should be taboo; 3. Avoid high-fat diet. Diet should be light, easy to digest, and less greasy. A high-fat diet can cause abnormal digestive function. Therefore, it is necessary to limit the intake of fat, especially animal fat; try not to eat fried food, chocolate, ice cream, butter, etc. Take it for 2 weeks to see the effect, if it is effective, take it for another 2-4 weeks, and stop the drug after the symptoms are basically improved; if the effect is not good, please perform gastrointestinal endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound in time for a clear diagnosis and then targeted treatment. The specific medications are: 1. Bifco Capsules, 2 capsules at a time, 3 times a day; 2. Trimebutine Maleate Tablets, 1 tablet at a time, 3 times a day, taken with meals.

It is recommended that you mainly adjust your diet and lifestyle to improve this disease: 1. Regular and moderate diet, regular and quantitative, and chewing slowly is conducive to intestinal digestion and absorption, and avoid overeating; 2. Avoid stimulating diets for suspicious diseases Tolerance or allergic food, such as shrimp, crab, etc. should be avoided as much as possible. Spicy, frozen, raw and cold food, late-night snacks, tobacco, alcohol, and coffee should be taboo; 3. Avoid high-fat diet. Diet should be light, easy to digest, and less greasy. A high-fat diet can cause abnormal digestive function. Therefore, it is necessary to limit the intake of fat, especially animal fat; try not to eat fried food, chocolate, ice cream, butter, etc. Take it for 2 weeks to see the effect, if it is effective, take it for another 2-4 weeks, and stop the drug after the symptoms are basically improved; if the effect is not good, please perform gastrointestinal endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound in time for a clear diagnosis and then targeted treatment.
